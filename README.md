# Sections
`Directories containing our practices`
# rules
1. all file and directory names should start lowercase and follow snake case rules.
2. do not alter other sections than yours unless it is a necessary change for all sections.
3. you can change other sections if the owner grants permission.
4. we will use .gitignore file to ignore other sections and just submit our section.
5. if other sections needed bug fixes then after fixing bug we will undo the ignoring and push the changes and then again ignore the sections in
.gitignore file.
6. when working on code goto .gitignore file and comment your section name so git will follow your changes.
# tutorials
`snake case`: names are given word by word and splited by ' - '. for example: my_test, this_is_a_function, lovely_day
but please avoid using long names and come up with names that are small and understandable i.e: apply_raise, del_raise

`.gitignore`: make a file and just name it **.gitignore** then put file or directory names in it and the git will ignore any changes made into those files and directories mentioned in the .gitignore file. **one** .gitignore file is enough for entire projects.
